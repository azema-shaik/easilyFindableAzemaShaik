# info_bot: LLM-Powered Internet and Bookstore Search Tool

## Overview

This project is my first successful agent, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to perform two primary tasks:

1. **Internet Search**: The agent can search the internet for a given query and provide a concise response.
2. **Bookstore Search (Fictional)**: The agent can interact with a fictional bookstore, retrieving information about available products based on a specified genre or book title.

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Search**: The agent uses LLMs to search the internet and extract relevant information, summarizing it into concise, actionable insights.
- **Bookstore Query**: The agent can read from a fictional bookstore database and provide detailed information about books, including title, price, stock availability, and descriptions.
